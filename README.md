### Hey, I'm Chris Kurcz ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 3rd-year student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Mathematics minor at Pennsylvania State University's Main Campus. Currently, I am seeking an internship or co-op to gain practical experience in the field. I am passionate about writing good code and solving difficult problems. With the right opportunity, I would love to improve my skillset and apply my existing knowledge.
